0	Welcome
<div>
0	So now that you know how to ssh as a user there is one last detail about ssh you should know
0	As you may know computers have many different ports that the internet can use to access a computer
0	Well these ports are what we use to ssh into a computer
0	So this leads me to the '-p' option for ssh
0	It works like all of the other options you have learned so far, so after the '-p' you put the port number separated by a space
0	To make this easier for you I have made a file that will update when you have a new computer that you can ssh to with all of the details you need
0	This file will always be placed in the root of the filesystems directories
0	It is a tab separated file which has: port '\t' username '\t' computer
0	When your done with this message the log file should be updated

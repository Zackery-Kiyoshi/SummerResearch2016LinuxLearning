0	Welcome to the first tutorial
0	The first command that you will learn is man
0	What man does is give you information about other commands
0	Try using man to learn what pwd does
wait	man	!~	pwd
<	2	Try 'man pwd'
0	Although this gives you the information about other commands to some they don't make since, this is why these tutorials exsist
0	The next command we will go through is pwd
0	What pwd does is show you the path to the directory that your in
0	Try using pwd
wait	pwd	!~	!~
<	2	try 'pwd'
0	The next command is called logname which just tells you what user you are logged in as
0	Try using logname
wait	logname	!~	!~
<	2	try 'logname'
0	This next command is slightly more complicated than the last ones because there are options that you can use
0	This command is 'ls' which will display the contents of the folder that your in, the different colors denote the type of file
0	Blue means its a folder
0	White means its a file
0	Try using just ls
wait	ls	!~	!~
<	2	try 'ls'
0	The first option I will introduce to you is 'l'
0	The l standing long this format will tell you most of the information you would want to know about a folder/file
0	To use the l option after ls you will put a -l separated by a space
0	Try using ls using the l option
wait	ls	-l	!~
<	2	try 'ls -l' 
0	ls with option 'a' will display hidden files and folders
0	Try using ls using the a option
wait	ls	-a	!~
<	2	try 'ls -a'
0	The last option is 'h' which will give you human readable sizes rather than just bytes
0	Try using ls using the h option
wait	ls	-h	!~
<	2	try 'ls -h'
0	This is not very helpfull because you don't see the size
0	So one thing that you can do with options is combine them
0	Lets try using ls with both the 'l' and 'h' options
wait	ls	-l -h	!~
<	2	try 'ls -l -h'
0	There are two ways that you could do multiple options: 'ls -l -h' or 'ls -lh' (order doesn't matter in this case but there are times when it does)
0	The last command you will learn in this tutorial is cd
0	What cd does is take 
0	Try using cd to look at whats in FirstFolder
wait	cd	!~	FirstFolder
<	2	try 'cd'
0	Congragulations on finishing your first tutorial
0	Now leave and start your adventure
<div>
This is the first tutorial which will introduce you to some of the basic commands: pwd, ls, cd, logname, clear
Good luck and have fun

1	Hello???
0	Welcome to the start of your hacking career
1	I'm already ready to start
0	Well do you know what the man pages are?
1	The what???
0	What about ssh?
1	sswhat?
0	Well I think you need to learn a few things before I can let you out into the world
1	What do I need to learn?
0	Lets start with the man pages, they are the documentation about the Linux bash commands
0	Try using man to learn what pwd does
wait	man	~!	pwd
<	2	Try 'man pwd'
0	Do you now understand what pwd does?
1	Kind of but these man pages are kind of confusing
0	Well thats why I'm going to go through some of these commands with you and there will also be tutorials to help you learn the commands
1	Thanks, so what does pwd do?
0	pwd just tells you what folder you are curently in, go ahead and try it
wait	pwd	~!	~!
<	2	Try 'pwd'
1	That seems like a useful command
0	It can be if you forget where you are
0	The next command 'ls' is used to display the contents of the folder that you are currently in. Try it yourself
wait	ls	~!	~!
<	2	Try 'ls'
0	The next command that you should know is 'cd' which allows you to change directories (hence the command being cd)
0	Try using cd to go into Documents
wait	cd	~!	Documents
<	2	Try 'cd Documents'
0	The next command is 'cat' which shows the contents of a file
0	Use cat on FirstTest0
wait	cat	~!	FirstTest0
<	2	Try 'cat FirstTest0'
1	That seems like the most useful command
0	Possibly but I would say that this final command might be more useful
0	Now lets learn how we can go to another computer, and no it does not require getting up and moving
0	This command is called 'ssh' it stands for Secure Shell
0	This command does take an argument which is the computer that you want to connect to
0	I have created a new system for you to go to called 'fun' so try using ssh to access fun
0	The command should look like 'ssh fun'

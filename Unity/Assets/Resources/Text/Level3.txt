0	This test will be short and is more of a tutorial to give you a couple of tools that might be helpfull
1	Why do I need to do this then? shouldn't I just do the tutorial????
0	Well you don't need to know all of the details that the tutorial has but these three commands can be helpfull
1	Alright lets get this over with
0	The first command I will go over just to make sure you remember
0	That command is cat, which displays the content of a file
0	Go ahead and cat TestFile
wait	cat	!~	TestFile
<	2	TestFile is in the root
0	Although it is nice to see the contents of a file sometimes it is too much to see on a single screen like TestFile
0	So the next two commands allow you to see just part of the contents of a file
0	The first is head like you might guess this command lets you thee the first ten lines of a file although that can be changed through options
0	Use head on TestFile to see for yourself
wait	head	!~	TestFile
<	2	TestFile is in the root
0	The last command does the opposite of head
0	The command is tail which shows the last 10 lines of a file, unless using options
0	Try using tail on TestFile
wait	tail	!~	TestFile
<	2	TestFile is in the root
1	So what is the next computer I need to go to
0	You must find it for yourself, good luck
wait	head	!~	NextTestLoc
<	2	Try checking in OtherStuff
<	2	Remember that some commands have options that might help
0	Before your done I need to tell you about a special command
0	That command is specific for certian systems, that command is quota
0	This command displays specific details about the users quota, for more information about what a quota is you should ask one of your professor or google
0	Go ahead and 
wait	quota	!~	!~
<	2	check in the Admin folder
0	For more information about these commands checkout the man pages or the tutorial before this level

NAME
       df - report filesystem disk space usage
SYNOPSIS
       df [OPTION]... [FILE]...
DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of df.  df displays the
       amount of disk space available on the filesystem containing  each  file
       name  argument.   If  no file name is given, the space available on all
       currently mounted filesystems is shown.  Disk  space  is  shown  in  1K
       blocks  by  default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
       set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node contain-
       ing a mounted filesystem, df shows the space available on that filesys-
       tem rather than on the filesystem containing the device node (which  is
       always  the root filesystem).  This version of df cannot show the space
       available on unmounted filesystems, because on most  kinds  of  systems
       doing  so  requires  very  nonportable intimate knowledge of filesystem
       structures.
OPTIONS
       Show information about the filesystem on which each  FILE  resides,  or
       all filesystems by default.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by) one  of  fol-
       lowing: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T,
       P, E, Z, Y.

NAME
       du - estimate file space usage
SYNOPSIS
       du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
DESCRIPTION
       Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       -S, --separate-dirs
              do not include size of subdirectories

       -s, --summarize
              display only a total for each argument

       SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed by) one  of  fol-
       lowing: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T,
       P, E, Z, Y.
